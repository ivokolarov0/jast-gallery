# JastUSA Account Game Library Overhaul

This project enhances the JastUSA account library, delivering an improved user experience.

Rather than displaying the basic library view with just a game cover and title, this update allows users to click on a game to access detailed information, view images, and download game files directly from the game's page, eliminating the need to return to the main library view.
